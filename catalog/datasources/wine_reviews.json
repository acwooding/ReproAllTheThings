(Does not have Taster info)\n\n  * `winemag-data-130k-v2.json` contains 6919 nodes of wine reviews.\n\nThe data consists of 13 fields:\n\n* Points: the number of points WineEnthusiast rated the wine on a scale of 1-100 (though they say they only post reviews for wines that score >=80)\n* Title: the title of the wine review, which often contains the vintage if you're interested in extracting that feature\n* Variety: the type of grapes used to make the wine (ie Pinot Noir)\n* Description: a few sentences from a sommelier describing the wine's taste, smell, look, feel, etc.\n* Country: the country that the wine is from\n* Province: the province or state that the wine is from\n* Region 1: the wine growing area in a province or state (ie Napa)\n* Region 2: sometimes there are more specific regions specified within a wine growing area (ie Rutherford inside the Napa Valley), but this value can sometimes be blank\n* Winery: the winery that made the wine\n* Designation: the vineyard within the winery where the grapes that made the wine are from\n* Price: the cost for a bottle of the wine\n* Taster Name: name of the person who tasted and reviewed the wine\n* Taster Twitter Handle: Twitter handle for the person who tasted ane reviewed the wine\n\nUPDATED 11/24/2017 Title, Taster Name, and Taster Twitter Handle were collected and the issue with duplicate entires was resolved\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nThe data was scraped from WineEnthusiast during the week of June 15th, 2017. The code for the scraper can be found here if you have any more specific questions about data collection that I didn't address. (https://github.com/zackthoutt/wine-deep-learning)\n\nUPDATE 11/24/2017\nAfter feedback from users of the dataset I scraped the reviews again on November 22nd, 2017. This time around I collected the title of each review, which you can parse the year out of, the tasters name, and the taster's Twitter handle. This should also fix the duplicate entry issue.",
